    <string name="doctor_success_stories">What experiences did you have that confirmed medicine was the right career for you?\n\nThroughout high school, I thought I would become an athletic trainer. At the start of undergrad, I was all set to pursue this but received news that the program was converting to a graduate-level degree. Left to find something new to pursue, I was fortunate enough to meet some physicians and surgeons through the athletics department. They invited me to spend some time with them in their clinics. They showed me the impact of their occupation through their interactions with patients and the ways they influenced the rural hospital system. From there, it was clear to me that becoming a physician would allow me to have the ability to do the most for the greatest number of people.\n\nAs a first-generation college graduate, I am constantly inspired by my parents because of the work ethic they show every day and instilled in me. Further, the sacrifices they made to give me the opportunity to pursue an education cannot be understated. Moreover, I am inspired by my home state of Montana. I love my home more than I can ever express and I hope to have the opportunity to return once my training is complete.</string>
